    abstract ={We studied the response of cerebral blood flow to acute step decreases in arterial blood pressure noninvasively and nonpharmacologically in 10 normal volunteers during normocapnia, hypocapnia, and hypercapnia. The step (approximately 20 mm Hg) was induced by rapidly deflating thigh blood pressure cuffs following a 2-minute inflation above systolic blood pressure. Instantaneous arterial blood pressure was measured by a new servo-cuff method, and cerebral blood flow changes were assessed by transcranial Doppler recording of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity. In hypocapnia, full restoration of blood flow to the pretest level was seen as early as 4.1 seconds after the step decrease in blood pressure, while the response was slower in normocapnia and hypercapnia. The time course of cerebrovascular resistance was calculated from blood pressure and blood flow recordings, and rate of regulation was determined as the normalized change in cerebrovascular resistance per second during 2.5 seconds just after the step decrease in blood pressure. The reference for normalization was the calculated change in cerebrovascular resistance that would have nullified the effects of the step decrease in arterial blood pressure on cerebral blood flow. The rate of regulation was 0.38, 0.20, and 0.11/sec in hypocapnia, normocapnia, and hypercapnia, respectively. There was a highly significant inverse relation between rate of regulation and PaCO2 (p less than 0.001), indicating that the response rate of cerebral autoregulation in awake normal humans is profoundly dependent on vascular tone.},

    abstract ={We investigated the validity of transcranial Doppler recordings for the analysis of dynamic responses of cerebral autoregulation. We found no significant differences in percentage changes among maximal (centerline) blood flow velocity, cross-sectional mean blood flow velocity, and signal power-estimated blood flow during 24-mm Hg stepwise changes in arterial blood pressure. We investigated blood flow propagation delays in the cerebral circulation with simultaneous Doppler recordings from the middle cerebral artery and the straight sinus. The time for a stepwise decrease in blood flow to propagate through the cerebral circulation was only 200 msec. Brief (1.37-second) carotid artery compression tests also demonstrated that the volume compliance effects of the cerebral vascular bed were small, only about 2.2% of normal blood flow in 1 second. Furthermore, transients associated with inertial and volume compliance died out after 108 msec. We also investigated the hypothesis that autoregulatory responses are influenced by hyperventilation using the same brief carotid artery compressions. One second after release, the flow index increased by 17% during normocapnia and 36% during hypocapnia. After 5 seconds, the flow index demonstrated a clear oscillatory response during hypocapnia that was not seen during normocapnia. These results suggest that the intact human cerebral circulation in the absence of pharmacological influences does not function as predicted from pial vessel observations in animals.},

    abstract = "Changes in the partial pressure of arterial \{CO2\} (PaCO2) regulates cerebrovascular tone and dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA). Elevations in PaCO2 also increases autonomic neural activity and may alter the arterial baroreflex. We hypothesized that hypercapnia would impair, and hypocapnia would improve, dynamic \{CA\} and that these changes would occur independently of any change in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). In 10 healthy male subjects, incremental hypercapnia was achieved through 4-min administrations of 4% and 8% CO2. Incremental hypocapnia involved two 4-min steps of hyperventilation to change end-tidal PCO2, in an equal and opposite direction, to that incurred during hypercapnia. End-tidal, arterial and internal jugular vein \{PCO2\} were sampled simultaneously at baseline and during each \{CO2\} step. Dynamic \{CA\} and \{BRS\} was assessed at baseline and during each step change in PaCO2 using spectral and transfer-function analysis of beat-by-beat changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate and flow velocity in the middle cerebral arterial (MCAv). Critical closing pressure (CCP), an estimate of cerebrovascular tone, was estimated from extrapolation of the MAP-MCAv waveforms. Hypercapnia caused a progressive increase in PaCO2 and \{MCAv\} whereas hypocapnia caused the opposite effect. Despite marked changes in CPP, there were no evident change in transfer-function gain, coherence, \{MAP\} variability or BRS; however, both \{MCAv\} variability and phase in the very-low frequency range was reduced during the most severe level of hyper- and hypocapnia (P &lt; 0.05), and were related to elevations in ventilation (R2 = 0.42–0.52, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). It seems that hyperventilation, rather than PaCO2, has an important influence on dynamic CA. "

Peak MCA velocity was measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and blood pressure was measured with a servo-controlled finger plethysmograph held level with the head. Waveforms from each cycle were added to obtain averaged waveforms of arterial blood pressure and MCA velocity. These results were processed by Fourier analysis to extract the phase difference between the fundamental components of velocity and pressure. Each volunteer performed the exercise three times: first breathing normally, secondly hyperventilating (hypocapnia), and finally while breathing air containing 5% carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Under these conditions the volunteers were expected to have normal, enhanced, and impaired autoregulation, respectively.Results The measurements made with normal breathing showed a phase lead of velocity ahead of pressure of 46±14° (mean±SD). We noted a highly significant reduction in phase lead with hypercapnia (P<.00015) (Wilcoxon signed rank test, two-tailed) and a highly significant increase in phase lead with hypocapnia (P<.002).Conclusions The results support our hypothesis and may lead to a technique for assessing the competence of cerebral autoregulation.},

    abstract ={Background and Purpose This study investigates the usefulness, as a test of dynamic autoregulation, of phase shift angle analysis between oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and in arterial blood pressure (ABP) during deep breathing.Methods Fifty healthy volunteers, 20 patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases (OCD), and 10 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) took part in the study. All subjects received transcranial Doppler monitoring of both middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). In addition, continuous blood pressure monitoring was performed with the use of noninvasive servo-controlled infrared finger plethysmography during deep breathing at a rate of 6/min. With the use of a high-pass filter model of autoregulation, autoregulation was quantified as phase shift angle between oscillations in CBFV and ABP at a frequency of 6/min. A phase shift angle of 0° indicates total absence of autoregulation, while 90° can be gauged as optimal autoregulation. In addition, vasomotor reactivity of both MCAs to CO2 stimulation was assessed among patients and calculated as percent increase in CBFV per millimeter of mercury of increase in CO2.Results All normal subjects showed positive phase shift angles between CBFV and ABP (mean±SD, 70.5±29.8°). OCD patients presented with significantly decreased phase shift angles for the MCA only on the pathological side (51.7±35.1°; P<.05). Patients with AVM showed significantly reduced phase shift angles on both the affected side (26.8±13.5°; P<.001) and the unaffected side (40.6±26.6°; P<.01). In patients’ groups, phase shift angle and vasomotor reactivity correlated significantly (r=.66; P<.001) after results from all MCAs were pooled.Conclusions Results confirm the high-pass filter model of cerebral autoregulation: Normal subjects showed predicted positive phase shift angles between CBFV and ABP oscillations. Patients with expected autoregulatory disturbances showed significant decreases in phase shift angles. Close correlations existed between autoregulation and CO2-induced vasomotor reactivity.},

To assess the temporal nature of autoregulation, transcranial Doppler velocity recordings of the middle cerebral artery obtained over prolonged periods were compared with blood pressure recordings in 5 patients without cerebral disease and in 13 patients with intracranial pathological changes. Correlations between the velocity and pressure wave forms at various frequencies of variation were measured with systems analysis techniques. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage had high correlations indicating pressure-dependent flow and impaired autoregulation. Patients without cerebral disease had significantly lower correlations (P less than 0.01), indicating intact autoregulation. Examples of increasing correlations and correlations at new frequencies emerging as the clinical condition worsened are given. These preliminary examples suggest that the application of systems analysis techniques to velocity and pressure data allow measurement of the temporal nature of cerebral autoregulation.}},

Rev. 78: 53{\textendash}97, 1998. {\textemdash} Several new concepts have emerged in relation to mechanisms that contribute to regulation of the cerebral circulation. This review focuses on some physiological mechanisms of cerebral vasodilatation and alteration of these mechanisms by disease states. One mechanism involves release of vasoactive factors by the endothelium that affect underlying vascular muscle. These factors include endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide), prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor(s). The normal vasodilator influence of endothelium is impaired by some disease states. Under pathophysiological conditions, endothelium may produce potent contracting factors such as endothelin. Another major mechanism of regulation of cerebral vascular tone relates to potassium channels. Activation of potassium channels appears to mediate relaxation of cerebral vessels to diverse stimuli including receptor-mediated agonists, intracellular second messengers, and hypoxia. Endothelial- and potassium channel-based mechanisms are related because several endothelium-derived factors produce relaxation by activation of potassium channels. The influence of potassium channels may be altered by disease states including chronic hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and diabetes.},

	abstract = {To decide whether tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) can account for renal autoregulation, we tested predictions of a TGF simulation. Broad-band and single-frequency perturbations were applied to arterial pressure; arterial blood pressure, renal blood flow and proximal tubule pressure were measured. Data were analyzed by linear systems analysis. Broad-band forcings of arterial pressure were also applied to the model to compare experimental results with simulations. With arterial pressure as the input and tubular pressure, renal blood flow, or renal vascular resistance as outputs, the model correctly predicted gain and phase only in the low-frequency range. Experimental results revealed a second component of vascular control active at 100-150 mHz that was not predicted by the simulation. Forcings at single frequencies showed that the system behaves linearly except in the band of 33-50 mHz in which, in addition, there are autonomous oscillations in TGF. Higher amplitude forcings in this band were attenuated by autoregulatory mechanisms, but low-amplitude forcings entrained the autonomous oscillations and provoked amplified oscillations in blood flow, showing an effect of TGF on whole kidney blood flow. We conclude that two components can be detected in the dynamic regulation of renal blood flow, i.e., a slow component that represents TGF and a faster component that most likely represents an intrinsic vascular myogenic mechanism.},

In the healthy subjects mean velocity rose significantly (P < .01) higher than arterial blood pressure after 30 seconds and 60 seconds; in the patients mean velocity and arterial pressure moved in parallel fashion. The diastolic blood flow velocity increased more in the control group than in the patients during the early stages of the test; furthermore, only in the healthy volunteers did it increase significantly more than arterial pressure after 30 seconds and 60 seconds. Regarding the pulsatility index, the differences between the two groups were similar to the diastolic velocity results.(1) Monitoring of mean blood flow velocity showed the ability to maintain an adequate cerebral blood flow in healthy subjects; this mechanism was not efficient in the patients with autonomic failure.

Data were recorded at rest (spontaneous changes in ABP) and during thigh cuff (step-wise changes) and lower body negative pressure (sinusoidal changes of 1/12 Hz) tests in both normocapnia and hypercapnia (5% CO2). Since autoregulation is modulated by CO2, respiratory \{CO2\} was simultaneously monitored to allow comparison of cerebral autoregulation status with different \{CO2\} levels. \{ABP\} and \{MCAv\} were fitted by \{ARX\} models and dynamic cerebral autoregulation was estimated by analysing both the step responses and phase shift at the 1/12 Hz of the corresponding \{ARX\} models. The \{ARX\} model consistently modelled the phase lead of \{MCAv\} to \{ABP\} and it showed that the phase shift at 1/12 Hz of \{ARX\} model is consistent with the real phase shift of the data (p=0.59). Strong linear relationships between pCO2 and gradient of the step response (r=−0.58, p&lt;0.0001) and between pCO2 and phase shift (r=−0.76, p&lt;0.0001) were observed, which suggests that cerebral autoregulation can be assessed by step response or phase shift analysis of the \{ARX\} model fitted to \{ABP\} and \{MCAv\} data with spontaneous changes.

    abstract={Cerebral autoregulation maintains a relatively constant blood flow despite changes of blood pressure in the brain. Linear models have been extensively applied to identify this mechanism, using spontaneous arterial blood pressure (ABP) fluctuation as input and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) change as output. Although valuable measurements have been achieved by these models, accuracy and consistency are of great concern due to the large variability of results. We therefore investigated whether more reliable measurements can be achieved by selecting only those recordings (or parts of recordings) with relatively high spontaneous variability of ABP. Twenty-four recordings, 7 from hypercapnia and 17 from normocapnia, of ABP and CBFV from 9 healthy adults were analyzed. Two conventional autoregulatory parameters were used to assess cerebral autoregulation. In the absence of a 'gold' standard for the study of dynamic cerebral autoregulation, lower variability of the parameters and higher correlation with pCO 2 were considered as criteria for identifying improved measures of autoregulation. Both significantly lower variability of the parameters, and higher correlation between the parameters and pCO 2 were achieved from the data with higher variability of blood pressure. We therefore conclude that ABP with high variability may effectively stimulate regulatory response in blood flow resulting in improved assessment of cerebral autoregulation.}

    abstract ={Background and Purpose—Dynamic methods of measuring cerebral autoregulation have become an accepted alternative to static evaluation. This article aims to describe a set of data collected from healthy volunteers by a dynamic method, the purpose being to qualify and quantify expected results for those who may be designing a study using this technique.Methods—Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) (measured by transcranial Doppler) and arterial blood pressure (Finapres) were recorded in 16 normal subjects before, during, and after the induction of a blood pressure drop (release of bilateral thigh cuffs). This procedure was repeated 6 times for each subject. A mathematical model was applied to the data to generate an autoregulatory index (ARI) with values between 0 and 9.Results—The ARI values for this sample population follow a normal distribution, with a mean±SD of 4.98±1.06 (n=15). Analysis of the cumulative mean ARI values of all subjects showed an exponential-type convergence of ARI toward the sample mean as the number of test iterations increased. The population average blood pressure drop on thigh cuff release was 26.4±7.1 mm Hg (n=16), occurring in 4.6±1.7 seconds. The corresponding population average drop for CBFV was 15.6±5.8 cm/s, taking 2.5±1.0 seconds. No significant trend was noted in the measurements as the number of test iterations increased. The correlation between the predicted and actual CBFV, having a mean value of 0.76±0.19, showed evidence of a nonlinear relationship to ARI values. Significant correlation was also found between ARI and (1) arterial blood pressure before cuff release and (2) the magnitude of the drop in CBFV on cuff release.Conclusions—The distribution of ARI values is not significantly different from normal. At least 3 iterations of the test procedure should be performed and averaged to obtain the mean ARI for each subject. There is no significant evidence of physiological accommodation as the number of test iterations increases. The effects of mean blood pressure and the magnitude of the change in CBFV should be considered as possible covariates when ARI data are analyzed.},

    ISSN={1664-042X} ,
    ABSTRACT={Objectives: The dynamic interaction between blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) is not fully understood, especially for CBFV changes lasting longer than 50 s. The interaction between BP and CBFV is relatively well characterized for periods <50 s using transfer function (TF) estimations of phase, gain, and coherence. We used TF estimations to compare the phase and gain for periods >50 s with those for periods <50 s.
    Material and Methods: BP and CBFV (of the middle cerebral artery) were simultaneously recorded in 23 healthy subjects (10 men, 13 women, mean age 35 ± 10 years) under normo- and hypocapnia (induced by hyperventilation). TF and coherence estimations were based on Welch’s periodogram method with a windowing of 200 seconds (frequency resolution, 0.005 Hz, corresponding to a period of 200 seconds. Means of the phase, gain, and coherence were calculated over frequency periods of 0.005–0.02 Hz (sVLF), 0.02–0.07 Hz (VLF), 0.07–0.15 Hz (LF), and 0.15–0.40 Hz (HF) and analyzed using the t-test and Pearson correlation.
    Results: Compared with the VLF range, normo- and hypocapnia phases were slightly but significantly lower in sVLF, while gain and coherence were not different. Hypocapnia induced significant (mostly p < 0.01) phase increases and gain decreases as well as coherence decreases in all frequency ranges. The phase and gain correlated significantly (−0.87 < r > −0.99) (p < 0.001) and inversely in all frequency ranges <0.15 Hz under both respiratory conditions. In some instances, the phase indicated disturbed autoregulation.
    Conclusion: In the frequency range <0.15 Hz, the phase and gain correlate highly and linearly with high consistency. The phase, gain, and coherence were similar in sVLF and VLF ranges. The phase was slightly lower in the sVLF range than in the VLF range. Notably, the data suggest that autoregulatory failure may occur in healthy persons.}

The mean arterial blood pressure and middle cerebral artery velocity spectral outline (Vmax), using transcranial Doppler, and ipsilateral internal carotid artery flow, using an electromagnetic flowmeter, were continuously and simultaneously recorded during transient sharp decreases in blood pressure that were induced by rapid deflation of thigh blood pressure cuffs. The resulting responses of velocity in the middle cerebral artery and flow in the internal carotid artery were compared.Moderate decreases in blood pressure evoked responses in cerebral autoregulation. There were no significant (P = .97) differences between the responses in middle cerebral artery velocity and internal carotid artery flow to the blood pressure decreases.Relative changes in Vmax accurately reflect relative changes in internal carotid artery flow during dynamic autoregulation testing in humans. Therefore, alterations in middle cerebral artery diameter do not occur to the extent that they introduce a significant error in making these comparisons.},

    abstract={Assessment of cerebral autoregulation is an important adjunct to measurement of cerebral blood flow for diagnosis, monitoring or prognosis of cerebrovascular disease. The most common approach tests the effects of changes in mean arterial blood pressure on cerebral blood flow, known as pressure autoregulation . A `gold standard' for this purpose is not available and the literature shows considerable disparity of methods and criteria. This is understandable because cerebral autoregulation is more a concept rather than a physically measurable entity. Static methods utilize steady-state values to test for changes in cerebral blood flow (or velocity) when mean arterial pressure is changed significantly. This is usually achieved with the use of drugs, shifts in blood volume or by observing spontaneous changes. The long time interval between measurements is a particular concern in many of the studies reviewed. Parallel changes in other critical variables, such as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0967-3334/19/3/001/img1.gif] , haematocrit, brain activation and sympathetic tone, are rarely controlled for. Proposed indices of static autoregulation are based on changes in cerebrovascular resistance, on parameters of the linear regression of flow/velocity versus pressure changes, or only on the absolute changes in flow. The limitations of studies which assess patient groups rather than individual cases are highlighted. Newer methods of dynamic assessment are based on transient changes in cerebral blood flow (or velocity) induced by the deflation of thigh cuffs, Valsalva manoeuvres, tilting and induced or spontaneous oscillations in mean arterial blood pressure. Dynamic testing overcomes several limitations of static methods but it is not clear whether the two approaches are interchangeable. Classification of autoregulation performance using dynamic methods has been based on mathematical modelling, coherent averaging, transfer function analysis, crosscorrelation function or impulse response analysis. More research on reproducibility and inter-method comparisons is urgently needed, particularly involving the assessment of pressure autoregulation in individuals rather than patient groups.

    abstract ={Background and Purpose—Assessment of cerebral autoregulation has been traditionally performed with static changes in arterial blood pressure. Newer dynamic methods require the induction of sudden drops in arterial blood pressure with the sudden release of bilateral thigh cuffs. An alternative method is proposed, based on the spontaneous variability of arterial blood pressure that does not require its manipulation. We compared this method with the established thigh cuff method in patients with carotid artery stenosis.Methods—Cerebral blood flow velocity (determined by transcranial Doppler) and arterial blood pressure (determined by noninvasive servo-controlled plethysmograph) were recorded in 20 patients with carotid artery stenosis and 18 age-matched controls. At rest, grading of dynamic autoregulation was estimated from the impulse response of the blood pressure–velocity dynamic relationship. This was compared with the autoregulatory index (ARI) provided by the thigh cuff method and with the degree of stenosis. The critical closing pressure was derived from the fitted models and was also correlated with degree of stenosis.Results—The 2 ARIs were significantly correlated (r=0.76) and reduced in subjects with carotid stenosis (baseline ARI, 3.65±3.11 versus 6.68±1.88, P<0.0001; thigh cuff ARI, 3.78±2.32 versus 6.35±1.06, P<10−5). The critical closing pressure (relative to mean arterial blood pressure) was also significantly reduced (−0.24±1.06 versus 0.50±0.31, P<0.0001) and correlated with the thigh cuff ARI (r=0.68). Both the baseline ARI and critical closing pressure were correlated with degree of stenosis (P<10−6).Conclusions—Grading of dynamic autoregulation with the use of undisturbed recordings of arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity might provide a safer technique for assessment of patients in whom a sudden drop of arterial blood pressure is not desirable, such as patients with heart or autonomic failure.},

In 47 normal subjects, ABP was measured with Finapres and CBFV was recorded with Doppler ultrasound in both middle cerebral arteries at rest in the supine position and also during ABP drops induced by the sudden deflation of thigh cuffs. Impulse response functions estimated by Fourier transfer function analysis, a second-order mathematical model proposed by Tiecks, and the linear kernel of the Volterra-Wiener moving-average representation provided reconstructed velocity model responses, for the same segment of data, with significant correlations to CBFV recordings corresponding tor = 0.52 {\textpm} 0.19, 0.53 {\textpm} 0.16, and 0.67 {\textpm} 0.12 (mean {\textpm} SD), respectively. The correlation coefficient for the linear plus quadratic kernels was 0.82 {\textpm} 0.08, significantly superior to that for the linear models (P \&lt; 10-6). The supine linear impulse responses were also used to predict the velocity transient of a different baseline segment of data and of the thigh cuff velocity response with significant correlations. In both cases, the three linear methods provided equivalent model performances, but the correlation coefficient for the nonlinear model dropped to 0.26 {\textpm} 0.25 for the baseline test set of data and to 0.21 {\textpm} 0.42 for the thigh cuff data. Whereas it is possible to model dynamic cerebral autoregulation in humans with different linear methods, in the supine position a second-order nonlinear component contributes significantly to improve model accuracy for the same segment of data used to estimate model parameters, but it cannot be automatically extended to represent the nonlinear component of velocity responses of different segments of data or transient changes induced by the thigh cuff test.},

A simple linear regression was also tested as a naive estimator. In 16 normal subjects, \{CBFV\} was continuously recorded with Doppler ultrasound and \{ABP\} with the Finapres device during six repeated thigh cuff manoeuvres. Using mean beat-to-beat values of \{ABP\} as input and \{CBFV\} as output, the performance of each method was assessed by the model’s predicted velocity correlation coefficient and normalized mean square error (MSE). Cross-validation was performed using three thigh cuff manoeuvres for the training data set and the other three for the validation set. The four methods studied performed significantly better than the zero-order naive estimator. The \{TLRN\} performed better than transfer function analysis, but was not significantly different from the time-domain techniques, despite showing the minimum predictive MSE. \{CBFV\} step responses could be extracted from the \{TLRN\} showing the presence of non-linear behaviour both in terms of amplitude and directionality."

The transfer function from respiratory activity to heart rate was determined during 6-min periods in which the respiratory rate was voluntarily controlled in a predetermined but erratic fashion. Changes in posture were used to manipulate autonomic balance. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia was determined to be a frequency-dependent phenomenon with the magnitude and phase characteristics of a low-pass filter. In agreement with previous work, at typical respiratory frequencies (greater than 0.15 Hz) increases in heart rate occurred simultaneously with the onset of inspiratory activity; however, at frequencies less than 0.15 Hz the phase relationship was quite different, such that increases in heart rate preceded inspiration. Between 0.15 and 0.45 Hz, the transfer magnitude was consistently lower while the subjects were in the upright posture than when in the supine posture, but below 0.15 Hz, it was equal in both postures. A model for respiratory modulation of heart rate, based on the atrial rate response characteristics determined in the companion paper [Am. J. Physiol. 256 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 25): H142-H152, 1989], suggests that the magnitude and phase characteristics of the subjects in the supine and upright postures differ because of relatively increased sympathetic outflow in the upright posture. A precise and efficient characterization of respiratory sinus arrhythmia can yield considerable insight into the autonomic regulation of the heart.},

To further investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in RSA and to understand the complex links between respiratory activity and arterial pressure, we determined the transfer functions between respiration, heart rate (HR), and phasic, systolic, diastolic, and pulse arterial pressures in 14 healthy subjects during 6-min periods in which the respiratory rate was controlled in a predetermined but erratic fashion. Pharmacological autonomic blockade with atropine, propranolol, and both, in combination with changes in posture, was used to characterize the sympathetic and vagal contributions to these relationships, as well as to dissect the direct mechanical links between respiration and arterial pressure from the effects of the RSA on arterial pressure. We found that 1) the pure sympathetic (standing + atropine) HR response is characterized by markedly reduced magnitude at frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz and a phase delay, whereas pure vagal (supine + propranolol) modulation of HR is characterized by higher magnitude at all frequencies and no phase delay; 2) both the mechanical links between respiration and arterial pressure and the RSA contribute significantly to the effects of respiration on arterial pressure; 3) the RSA contribution to arterial pressure fluctuations is significant for vagal but not for sympathetic modulation of HR; 4) the mechanical effects of respiration on arterial pressure are related to the negative rate of change of instantaneous lung volume; 5) the mechanical effects have a higher magnitude during systole than during diastole; and 6) the mechanical effects are larger in teh standing than the supine position. Most of these findings can be explained by a simple model of circulatory control based on previously published experimental transfer functions from our laboratory.},

    abstract ={Background and Purpose A simple method of testing cerebral autoregulation by observing transcranial Doppler changes in middle cerebral artery flow velocity (FV) during a brief ipsilateral carotid artery compression (the transient hyperemic response test) was studied in 11 normal healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of the method and to compare derived autoregulatory indices with those of a standard noninvasive test of autoregulation, Aaslid's leg-cuff test.Methods Volunteers were subjected to repeated carotid compressions and leg-cuff tests at different levels of CO2. Hypercapnia was induced using inhalation of a mixture of 5% CO2 in air. Hypocapnia was induced by moderate hyperventilation. To assess the influence of the duration of carotid compression, a series of carotid compressions lasting 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 seconds were performed in random sequence. Monitored parameters included ipsilateral FV, end-tidal CO2, and arterial blood pressure. The transient hyperemic response ratio (THRR), calculated as the maximum increase of FV divided by baseline values after release of the carotid compression, was taken as the autoregulation index. This index was compared with the rate of autoregulation index derived from the leg-cuff test.Results Both tests were significantly associated with end-tidal CO2 (ANOVA, P<.000001 for both carotid compression and cuff test). There was a linear correlation between THRR and autoregulation index (r=.86). However, the reproducibility of the THRR was more consistent than for the autoregulation index from single tests (13% versus 46%, respectively; P<.0001). Although the influence of the duration of carotid compression on THRR values was significant for carotid compressions lasting up to 5 seconds, there was no relation to the relative magnitude of FV drop during the compression.Conclusions Brief (>5 seconds) carotid artery compression provides an index of cerebral autoregulation that is reproducible and is affected by CO2 tension in a fashion similar to autoregulatory indices derived from a standard leg-cuff test. The simplicity of the method provides a potentially useful addition to other noninvasive autoregulation tests for clinical assessments, particularly when repeated measurements are required.},

    Abstract={Although inhalation anesthetic agents are thought to impair cerebral autoregulation more than intravenous agents, there are few controlled studies in humans.\\ In the first group (n = 24), dynamic autoregulation was assessed from the response of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (Vmca) to a transient step decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). The transient hypotension was induced by rapid deflation of thigh cuffs after inflation for 3 min. In the second group (n = 18), static autoregulation was studied by observing Vmca in response to a phenylephrine-induced increase in MABP. All patients were studied during fentanyl (3 micrograms.kg-1.h-1)/nitrous oxide (70%) anesthesia, followed by, in a randomized manner, isoflurane, desflurane, or propofol in a low dose (0.5 MAC or 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and a high dose (1.5 MAC or 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). The dynamic rate of regulation (dROR) was assessed from the rate of change in cerebrovascular resistance (MABP/Vmca) with the blood pressure decreases using computer modeling, whereas the static rate of regulation (sROR) was assessed from the change in Vmca with the change in MABP.\\ Low-dose isoflurane delayed (dROR decreased) but did not reduce the autoregulatory response (sROR intact). Low-dose desflurane decreased both dROR and sROR. During 1.5 MAC isoflurane or desflurane, autoregulation was ablated (both dROR and sROR impaired). Neither dROR nor sROR changed with low- or high-dose propofol.\\ At 1.5 MAC, isoflurane and desflurane impaired autoregulation whereas propofol (200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) preserved it.},

    abstract ={Background and Purpose Cerebral autoregulation can be evaluated by measuring relative blood flow changes in response to a steady-state change in the blood pressure (static method) or during the response to a rapid change in blood pressure (dynamic method). The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the two methods in humans with both intact and impaired autoregulatory capacity.Methods Using intraoperative transcranial Doppler sonography recordings from both middle cerebral arteries, we determined static and dynamic autoregulatory responses in 10 normal subjects undergoing elective surgical procedures. The changes in cerebrovascular resistance were estimated from the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure in response to manipulations of blood pressure. Static autoregulation was determined by analyzing the response to a phenylephrine-induced rise in blood pressure, whereas rapid deflation of a blood pressure cuff around one thigh served as a stimulus for testing dynamic autoregulation. Both measurements were performed in patients with intact autoregulation during propofol anesthesia and again in the same patients after autoregulation had been impaired by administration of high-dose isoflurane.Results There was a significant reduction in autoregulatory capacity after the administration of high-dose isoflurane, which could be demonstrated using static (P<.0001) and dynamic (P<.0001) methods. The correlation between static or steady-state and dynamic autoregulation measurements was highly significant (r=.93, P<.0001).Conclusions These data show that in normal human subjects measurement of dynamic autoregulation yields similar results as static testing of intact and pharmacologically impaired autoregulation.},

    abstract = {{Background and Purpose Knowledge is limited about the effects of the Valsalva maneuver on cerebral circulation because of the poor temporal resolution of traditional cerebral blood flow measurements. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in cerebral blood flow during the Valsalva maneuver and to explore its potential use for the evaluation of cerebral autoregulation.  Methods Using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we simultaneously recorded systemic arterial blood pressure in the radial artery and flow velocities in both middle cerebral arteries in 10 healthy adults during the Valsalva maneuver. Gosling's pulsatility index was calculated for all phases of the Valsalva maneuver. Autoregulatory capacities were estimated from the change in cerebrovascular resistance (flow velocity in relationship to blood pressure) during phase II and changes in the velocity-pressure relationship in phase IV relative to phase I.  Results The characteristic changes in blood pressure (phases I to IV) were seen in all subjects, accompanying distinct changes in cerebral blood flow velocity. The relative changes in mean velocity during phases II and IV were significantly greater than those in mean blood pressure. Compared with the baseline value, velocity decreased by 35\% in phase IIa, then rose by 56.5\% in phase IV (corresponding changes in blood pressure were -10.2\% and +29.8\%, respectively). During phase II, the pulsatility and cerebrovascular resistance decreased by 19.9\%. The increase in cerebral blood flow velocity in phase IV was significantly higher than in phase I (P<.0004), and there was no corresponding significant difference in blood pressure.  Conclusions These results demonstrated that in healthy humans the Valsalva maneuver causes characteristic changes in systemic blood pressure as well as in flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery, reflecting the sympathetic and cerebral autoregulatory responses, respectively. Analysis of these changes may provide an estimate of autoregulatory capacity.}},

    abstract ={Background and Purpose Transcranial Doppler sonography has recently been used to describe cerebral hemodynamics during the Valsalva maneuver in normal human subjects. Since some changes in flow velocity during the Valsalva maneuver seem to reflect the brain's autoregulatory response to a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure during the strain, we hypothesized that this method could identify vascular territories with impaired autoregulatory capacity.Methods Eight patients with unilateral (n=7) or bilateral (n=1) severe obstruction of the internal carotid artery and impaired vascular responses to the CO2 reactivity test and to dynamic autoregulation testing were studied. We compared changes in flow velocities and blood pressures during defined phases of the Valsalva maneuver in the patients with the results in a group of 17 normal volunteers. We defined two indices to evaluate autoregulatory capacity based on the response to the Valsalva maneuver.Results During the Valsalva maneuver, changes in flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries ipsilateral to the lesions showed characteristic abnormalities compared with the normal pattern. Autoregulatory indices of these vessels as defined by the Valsalva maneuver were significantly different from those with normal vascular reactivity to CO2 (P<.0001). There were good correlations between an index based on the changes in flow velocity and blood pressure in phase II and the results of the CO2 test (r=.78; P<.0001) or those of dynamic autoregulatory testing (r=.6; P<.0001).Conclusions Vascular territories with severely impaired vasomotor reactivity due to carotid obstruction can be identified by transcranial Doppler sonography by their pattern of flow velocity changes if their autoregulatory capacity is challenged during the Valsalva maneuver.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that spontaneous changes in cerebral blood flow are primarily induced by changes in arterial pressure and that cerebral autoregulation is a frequency-dependent phenomenon, we measured mean arterial pressure in the finger and mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V˙MCA) during supine rest and acute hypotension induced by thigh cuff deflation in 10 healthy subjects. Transfer function gain, phase, and coherence function between changes in arterial pressure andV˙MCA were estimated using the Welch method. The impulse response function, calculated as the inverse Fourier transform of this transfer function, enabled the calculation of transient changes inV˙MCA during acute hypotension, which was compared with the directly measured change in V˙MCA during thigh cuff deflation. Beat-to-beat changes inV˙MCA occurred simultaneously with changes in arterial pressure, and the autospectrum of V˙MCA showed characteristics similar to arterial pressure. Transfer gain increased substantially with increasing frequency from 0.07 to 0.20 Hz in association with a gradual decrease in phase. The coherence function was \&gt;0.5 in the frequency range of 0.07{\textendash}0.30 Hz and \&lt;0.5 at \&lt;0.07 Hz. Furthermore, the predicted change inV˙MCA was similar to the measuredV˙MCA during thigh cuff deflation. These data suggest that spontaneous changes inV˙MCA that occur at the frequency range of 0.07{\textendash}0.30 Hz are related strongly to changes in arterial pressure and, furthermore, that short-term regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to changes in arterial pressure can be modeled by a transfer function with the quality of a high-pass filter in the frequency range of 0.07{\textendash}0.30 Hz.},
